      <p>
        The data used was collected during the year 2018. We need to keep into

      <p>
        The specific dataset was gathered from a Kaggle page containing a
        collection of Air Traffic Data with a span from 2009 to 2018, it can be
        found here:

        5. Short abstract of the data visualization process:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The dataset was processed using python, it didnâ€™t require any
        pre-processing and alongside the Airports Dataset containing IATA code and
        coordinates available on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics site, for
        each of the visualizations we saved a new file containing only the
        necessary columns for the specific use case.

        6. Actions performed to obtain each visualization:
      </h3>
      <p>
        An ordered list of all the actions performed and parameters and scripts
        used to transform the raw data into the final visualization is available in
        the <a onclick="myFunction4()">MAP PROTOCOL</a> section of each map/plot.

          7. Data used to obtain this visualization:
        </h3>
        <p>
          The data used in this visualization regards only the fields about position of the airports and user ratings for each airport (this data was obtained using a custom-made web scraping tool).<br>
          All the User Rating Data was found on: <a href="https://skytraxratings.com/" target="_blank">SkyTraxRatings.com</a>, <a href="https://www.airhelp.com/en-int/airhelp-score/airport-ranking/" target="_blank">AirHelp.com</a> and <a href="https://www.airlinequality.com/review-pages/a-z-airport-reviews/airport-review-ratings/" target="_blank">AirlineQuality.com</a>
